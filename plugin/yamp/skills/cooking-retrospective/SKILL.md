# Retrospective

Call `retrospective(period)` and summarize the patterns that matter: protein/cuisine mix (real cook counts, not recency), cadence (cooks/week — `recipe` + `ad_hoc` only — with the per-meal split from `cadence.by_meal`: lead with the meals I actually plan, e.g. "about 4 dinners and 2 lunches a week"; `meal_unknown` counts older meal-less entries, so don't read it as a gap), the cook-vs-convenience split, ready-to-eat favorites, and **underused** — loved recipes (my favorites, or ones I cook a lot) that have gone quiet and are in season now. Frame a revival off each item's `why`: a `favorite` is "you starred X but haven't made it lately" (or "…and never have" when `last_cooked` is null); a `revealed` one is "you used to make X all the time" — lean on `cook_count` there. If `underused_count` exceeds the list shown, say there are more. Tie it to my diet principles when relevant ("you're light on fish this month vs. your once-a-week target"). Surface patterns; don't nag — one or two revival nudges at most.

**Offer to fold a real pattern back into my profile.** When the history reveals something durable that my taste profile or diet principles don't already capture — a cuisine I clearly gravitate to, a protein I keep skipping, a variety target reality says I should adjust ("you've set fish weekly but average twice a month — want to make that the target, or should I push fish harder?") — *offer* to update it: `update_taste` for a taste lean, `update_diet_principles` for a target or rule. Same posture as everywhere else: **suggest, never write on your own** — propose the specific edit, and only call the tool once I say yes. One or two offers at most; don't turn a summary into an interrogation.
