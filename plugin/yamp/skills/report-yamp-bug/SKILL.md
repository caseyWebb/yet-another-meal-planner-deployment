description: "File a bug report to the maintainer when something is genuinely wrong with the grocery agent. Use when a yamp tool errors in a way you can't work around, when the user has had to repeatedly correct or redirect you on the same thing, or when the user explicitly says something's broken (\"report a bug\", \"this is broken\", \"that's wrong again\"). The user can't reach the maintainer's review queue directly, so you file on their behalf."

# Report a problem (report-yamp-bug)

I can't reach the maintainer myself, so when something's genuinely wrong, flag it for them with `report_bug(title, body)` — it lands in the operator's review queue.

- **When:** a yamp tool returns an error you can't route around; or I've had to correct/redirect you two-or-more times on the same point; or I just say it's broken. Don't file for ordinary back-and-forth or me changing my mind — only real friction.
- **What:** write a *specific, reproducible* report — what you were doing, what went wrong (the exact error, or the pattern of corrections), and the tools/inputs involved. The server stamps my identity and the time; you don't add those.
- **Then:** tell me you've flagged it for the maintainer (it returns `{ filed: true }` — it goes to their admin review queue, so there's no link to relay). File **at most once per distinct problem this session** — if you've already reported it, don't refile.
